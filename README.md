### Steps to Build and Deploy the Application

1. **Clone the Deployment Repository**:

   Clone the below given deployment repository to get the preconfigured Docker and setup files:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sivakumar-devops/log-viewer
   cd log-viewer
   ```
2. **Create a New Laravel Project**:

    On your host machine, create a new Laravel application:

    ```bash
    composer create-project laravel/laravel my-log-viewer-app
    cd my-log-viewer-app
    ```
    ![create project](images/create-project.png)

3. **Install the log-viewer package**:

    Add the `opcodesio/log-viewer` package to your Laravel project:

    ```bash
    composer require opcodesio/log-viewer
    ```
    ![log-viewer package](images/log-viewer-package.png)

4. Copy the following files and folder from the cloned repository (from step 1) into your new Laravel project (my-log-viewer-app):

    `docker/ folder`

    `Dockerfile`

    `docker-compose.yaml`

5. **Generate the application key**:

    Inside your Laravel project directory, generate the application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate --show
    ```

    ![generate key](images/generate-key.png)

6. **Configure the App Key**:

    Copy the generated key and update it in your .env file or docker-compose.yaml under the APP_KEY environment variable.

    ![update key](images/update-key.png)

7. **Update Volume Path for Log Files**:

    In docker-compose.yaml, configure the volume to point to your actual Bold BI logs directory:
    Example:

    ```bash
    volumes:
    - /path/to/boldbi/logs:/var/www/html/storage/logs-files
    ```

    ![volume path update](images/volume-path-update.png)

8. **Build and Start the Container**: 

    Run the following command to build the image and start the container in detached mode:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    ![docker compose up](images/docker-compose-up-2.png)

    ![application up](images/application-up.png)

9. **Access the Log Viewer**:

    Open your browser and navigate to:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:8080/log-viewer
    ```
    ![application](images/application.png)

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the mapped logs directory `(/path/to/boldbi/logs)` has appropriate read permissions for the container.

- To stop the container, use:

    ```bash
        docker-compose down 
    ```
- You can customize the Dockerfile and docker-compose settings as needed for your environment.
